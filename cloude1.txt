This application shows a good architectural foundation for a medicine warehouse management system. The code demonstrates solid object-oriented design principles and proper separation of concerns between the database layer and GUI components.
Key Strengths:

Well-structured database schema with proper relationships
Role-based access control system
Modular, extensible codebase
Good use of Tkinter for cross-platform compatibility

Major Gaps:

Security: Plain text passwords (critical vulnerability)
Core Features: Missing actual warehouse operations (stock in/out, inventory tracking)
Incomplete Implementation: Most frames are placeholders
No Reporting: Essential for business operations

The application is about 30% complete and would need significant development work to become production-ready. The most critical next steps would be implementing proper password security, completing the core warehouse operations, and adding a comprehensive reporting system.
Would you like me to help you implement any specific features or address particular concerns from this evaluation?
